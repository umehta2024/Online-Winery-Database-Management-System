# Online-Winery-Database-Management-System
Author - Upasana Mehta, Pranav Bawiskar
We are working on an online winery database management system that assists with managing the entire wine-selling process from grape to bottle to customer. 
The system manages placing the orders of wine, managing accounts of winery owners and customers, orders placed by customers, contents of an order, 
wines produced at wineries, wines stocked at inventories, charcuterie boards and takes note of the regions where the wineries are located.

Our web application is based on some dummy data and real data(web scraping) from Crackerbarrelcheese and MensJournal. We have a total of 10 entities 
and 9 relations in our database.
